# React-Hooks


1. useState => The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. 
so basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component. The first state being set initially and the second one is a function used to 
update the state value.

2. useReducer => Works as same as the useState. When more than one state or many states is being updated at the same time, useReducer can be used. It takes in the states as
objects and second argument in the array is dispatch to dispactch the state action. In the useReduces funtion, first argument is reducer function and
in second argument, initial states in objects defined .
